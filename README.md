# Persian_digit_classification
For this project i used a dataset of persian digit pictures which has 60000 samples to classificate them. I used KNN, XGBOOST algorithm to train the model and finally i used VOTINGCLASSIFIER to combine these algorithms to get a better accuracy. I hope it is usefull for you!
